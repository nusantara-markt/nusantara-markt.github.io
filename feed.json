            "content_html": "<p class=\"blogs_p\">Indonesian cuisine is rich in spice and herbs. From the simplest dish like Sambal to the complicated, slow-cooked Rendang, herbs are indeed important ingredients to add flavor and aroma to the foods.</p>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">Although it seems that Indonesian cooking is very difficult, it’s not really true. In fact it’s really easy, if you know the types of herbs you are going to use in the cooking, and how to use them.</p>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">Below are some of the essential herbs (Bahasa: bumbu dapur) used in Indonesian dishes, that you might be not familiar with:</p>\n<h3 class=\"blogs_h3\">Tamarind (Asam)</h3>\n<figure class=\"blogs__img\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/assets/img/blogs/blogs_001/tamarind.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/tamarind.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/tamarind-xs.jpg 384w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/tamarind-sm.jpg 600w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/tamarind-md.jpg 768w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/tamarind-lg.jpg 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\"></figure>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">Asam or tamarind is a main herb for Sayur Asam. It is also commonly used to get rid of fishy aroma in seafood. The right way to use tamarind in Indonesian foods is by soaking tamarind in warm water, and straining the water from its residue.</p>\n<h3 class=\"blogs_h3\">Kaffir Lime Leaves (Daun Jeruk Purut)</h3>\n<figure class=\"blogs__img\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/assets/img/blogs/blogs_001/kaffir.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/kaffir.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kaffir-xs.jpg 384w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kaffir-sm.jpg 600w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kaffir-md.jpg 768w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kaffir-lg.jpg 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\"></figure>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">The leaves have a subtle fragrance which gives a distinctive taste to many lemon grass based dishes, such as Soto, Rawon, Rendang, and certain types of coconut milk-based dishes. Usually, kaffir lime leaves are used along with lemongrass, bay leaves, and galangal.</p>\n<h3 class=\"blogs_h3\">Bay Leaves (Daun Salam)</h3>\n<figure class=\"blogs__img\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/assets/img/blogs/blogs_001/bay.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/bay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/bay-xs.jpg 384w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/bay-sm.jpg 600w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/bay-md.jpg 768w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/bay-lg.jpg 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\"></figure>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">Like kaffir lime leaves, bay leaf also gives a subtle flavor to dishes.

To use slaked lime in Indonesian dishes, you need to mix one part of slaked lime with two parts of water. Let it settle for one hour, and use only the clear water part of the mixture for cooking purpose. Usually, slaked lime water is used in order to make food ingredients crispier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"blogs_h3\">Candlenuts (Kemiri)</h3>\n<figure class=\"blogs__img\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/assets/img/blogs/blogs_001/kemiri.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/kemiri-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kemiri-2-xs.jpg 384w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kemiri-2-sm.jpg 600w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kemiri-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/kemiri-2-lg.jpg 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\"></figure>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">The waxy white kernel cannot be used as a single herb, but must be ground together with other spices like garlic, shallots, chilies, and shrimp paste (terasi). Candlenuts are used as thickening agent for sauces of many Indonesian dishes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"blogs_h3\">Galangal (Lengkuas)</h3>\n<figure class=\"blogs__img\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/assets/img/blogs/blogs_001/lengkuas.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/lengkuas.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/lengkuas-xs.jpg 384w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/lengkuas-sm.jpg 600w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/lengkuas-md.jpg 768w ,https://nusantara-markt.com/media/posts/8/responsive/lengkuas-lg.jpg 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\"></figure>\n<p class=\"blogs_p\">Galangal has a similar texture to ginger, but has different aroma and color.
